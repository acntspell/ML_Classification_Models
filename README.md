## Project Overview

The goal of this assignment is to apply various machine-learning algorithms to the given problem:

A target marketing campaign for a bank was undertaken to identify customer segments likely to respond to a variable annuity (insurance product) marketing campaign. This project collected data from 32,264 banking customers during three months. The data set was created with one output variable and 47 input variables. The output variable is a binary variable called Ins. It indicates whether the customer bought an insurance product. The data set is called Insurance Purchase.

The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model training, and evaluation using ANN, logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models.
